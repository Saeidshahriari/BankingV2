# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Workflow

1. **Fork** the repo and create a feature branch:  
   `git checkout -b feature/<short-topic>`
2. **Write/Update tests** in `src/test/java`.
3. **Run** all tests locally: `mvn -q clean test`
4. **Open a Pull Request** to `main` and describe your changes.

## Coding style

- Use clear method names and Javadoc for public methods.
- Prefer meaningful exceptions over magic return values.
- Keep tests independent and readable.
